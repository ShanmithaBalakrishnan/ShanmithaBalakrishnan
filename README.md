I'm Shanmitha, a budding software engineer and tech enthusiast from Chennai.

I'm currently in my final year of Computer Science, where Iâ€™ve led and contributed to multiple projects â€” from building an IoT-based railway gate automation system to developing a full-fledged money management Android app. Iâ€™ve interned as a web developer, working with React and collaborating closely with UI/UX teams to deliver real-world CRM solutions.

Iâ€™m passionate about creating meaningful, user-centered applications and have a strong foundation in Python, and DSA. Iâ€™ve also represented my college in national conferences and secured podium finishes in intercollegiate paper presentations.

Beyond code, I enjoy writing blogs, exploring leadership and personal growth, and staying curious about the future of tech.

Letâ€™s connect!
